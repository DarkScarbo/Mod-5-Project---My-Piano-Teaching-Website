      <h2>Tutoring Experience:</h2>
      <p>
        I have been teaching the piano for over 10 years to the full range of
        students, from those just starting their journey all the way to
        professionals. My repertoire includes both the classical and also the
        jazz tradition.
      </p>
      <h2>Tutorial Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a dedicated and passionate teacher with a thorough approach, always
        getting the best out of my students. I adapt to new students with ease,
        teaching in a clear, relaxed, supportive and friendly way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important objective of a lesson is that they are fun, engaging,
        and rewarding. I have an individualized approach that focuses on each
        student's strengths and areas for improvement in a highly supportive and
        encouraging environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach to teaching is flexible and I'm very happy to tailor to my
        student’s needs. I will happily stick to an exam board syllabus, avoid
        this entirely, or offer some combination of approach – whatever suits! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of the lessons I can teach include learning pieces, music
        theory, improvisation, ear training, sight reading, musicality and exam
        preparation, plus I have a particular interest in posture and technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of each lesson (If they are happy with this) students are
        given weekly assignments for them to work on during the week.
