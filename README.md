## Piano teacher platform
This is a platform that shows my website as a pianist, then, a student can sign up or log in and make bookings, upload videos of themselves playing and have messages with me. As a teacher, I can log in and accept or refuse bookings, write a review for each video and have messeges with all the students. The App uses its own API for storing all the data.

## Motivation
This is the fifth and last proyect for the Flatiron School Software Engineering bootcamp. The basic requirements for this project are the use of Ruby on Rails for the back-end an React for the front-end.
